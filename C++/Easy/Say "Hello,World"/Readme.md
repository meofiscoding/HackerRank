We're starting out by printing the most famous computing phrase of all time! In the editor below, use either printf or cout to print the string  __Hello, World!__ to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29). 

The more popular command form is cout. It has the following basic form:

` cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print; `

Any number of values can be printed using one command as shown.

The ` printf ` command comes from C language. It accepts an optional format specification and a list of variables. Two examples for printing a string are:

`printf("%s", string); printf(string);`

Note that neither method adds a newline. It only prints what you tell it to.

#### Output Format ####

Print __Hello, World!__ to stdout.
