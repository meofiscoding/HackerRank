Consider __P1(a,c)__ and __P2(b,d)__ to be two points on a 2D plane where __(a,b)__ are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and __(c,d)__ are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in __STATION__.

Query the [Euclidean](https://www.cuemath.com/euclidean-distance-formula/) Distance between points __P1__ and __P2__ and format your answer to display __4__ decimal digits.

#### Input Format#### 

The __STATION__ table is described as follows:
